# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This is a pretty straight forward software. All it does is print Hello World using python code.

The purpose of this software is to help me improve my programing abilities by helping me practice the basics of code.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
